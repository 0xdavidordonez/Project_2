## Welcome to the Moon App :rocket:!

Are you ready to explore the fascinating realm where lunar cycles intersect with the world of trading? Welcome aboard the Moon App, where we delve into the intriguing connection between the phases of the moon and Bitcoin trading. Our mission is to develop an easy trading strategy leveraging signals from Bollinger Bands and lunar cycles, specifically focusing on the full moon and new moon phases. 

## What is it?

The Moon App is an innovative project designed to harness the power of celestial events in guiding Bitcoin trading decisions. By integrating signals from Bollinger Bands with the lunar cycle, particularly during full moon and new moon phases, we aim to develop a unique trading strategy that capitalizes on the potential correlations between lunar cycles and market behavior. With our platform, traders can explore a novel approach to analyzing market trends, gaining insights into how lunar phases may impact asset prices and trading dynamics.

A 20-year study by the University of Lausanne showed that trading strategies based on the full moon and lunar cycles outperformed the overall market by an average of 3.3% per year.
Also, according to a study conducted by the University of Zurich, trading strategies based on the lunar cycle have outperformed the market by an average of 6.8% per year over a period of five years.

## Objective

Our primary objective with the Moon App is to provide traders with a sophisticated yet accessible tool for incorporating lunar cycle analysis into their trading strategies. By executing buy signals when the asset touches the lower Bollinger Band during a full moon and sell signals when it touches the upper band during a new moon, we aim to empower traders to make informed decisions based on both technical indicators and lunar phenomena. Through this integration, we strive to enhance trading performance and unlock new avenues for profitability in the dynamic world of Bitcoin trading.
